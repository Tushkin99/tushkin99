### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:
### My name is Artur Deriglazov

I worked at the Bank of Russia for almost three years, and therefore I was used to dealing with large amounts of data of various forms and types. Also I finished a year-long course in the field of Data Analyst and learned specific subjects: marketing analytics, A/B tests, analysis of product metrics.
In recent months, I have become actively interested in machine learning.

**Data analysis and visualization tools:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium.

**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server.
